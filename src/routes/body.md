# Incredible, right?

Well there's more where that came from! Feel free to peruse the site to see where I've worked, what I'm working on, and an exclusive view into the mess of configurations that I've built up over the past couple years. Navigate with the top bar, and enjoy!

# About Me

I am a rising Junior at the University of Florida studying Computer Engineering. I'm particularly interested in audio engineering/music production and operating systems, but I dabble in all sorts of other areas as well, like keyboard design, a capella singing, and modular synths. The goal of this website is to serve as a central place for me to document every cool thing that I have ever done, and if I ever figure out to do proper SEO, will hopefully also be a place with useful information that I couldn't find a clear guide on anywhere else.

# Site overview

The [E-Portfolio](./e-portfolio) section of the site is a collection of my research experiences and a journal for the University Research Scholars Program at UF. 
The Config section is a potentially un-asked-for deep dive into how I have my layers upon layers of tools and abstractions set up - it may be interesting to some! 
The Blog is a collection of various posts about projects that I've done or snippets of code/configurations that took me a long time to figure out.
Finally, the Resume page is basically an expanded version of my print resume detailing where I've worked and what I did at those positions.

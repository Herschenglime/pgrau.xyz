# URSP E-Portfolio

## What is URSP?

URSP, or the 
[University Research Scholars Program](https://cur.aa.ufl.edu/programs/university-research-scholars-program), is a program at UF designed to introduce undergraduates to the process of conducting research and support them as they carry out their research journey.

One of the requirements for URSP is to create an E-Portfolio like the one that you are reading now showcasing my academic and research experience.

This will be updated over time as I gain more experience in the Lab. For now, feel free to peruse the [Journal](./e-portfolio/journal) of entries required for the program.
